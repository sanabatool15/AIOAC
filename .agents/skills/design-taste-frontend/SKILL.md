  tasteskill 2.5.1, the anti-slop frontend skill. Builds professional company websites at the level
  of figma.com and x.ai: plain copy in a voice of its own, one system, one section per screen,
  equal edges, real photographs and real product UI (licensed stand-in photographs when the client
  has none; a product render only when the brief asks for 3D), a hero entrance and one or two dealt
  moments on every page, shader effects and scenes only on tech, gaming and software pages, quiet
  micro-interactions, and a checker and finish gate that enforce it in a real browser. Use this
  whenever you build, design, redesign, restyle, polish or review a landing page, company,
  product, shop, cafe, hotel, studio, SaaS, AI, developer-tool or game site, as static HTML/CSS or
  inside an existing React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Astro or Tailwind project, or when the user says
  a page looks generic, templated or "AI-made".

# tasteskill 2.5

Build the website a good company would ship: it says plainly what is sold, shows the real thing on
every screen, and looks made for this client, not from a template and not like an art piece.
figma.com and x.ai are the bar (in words: `layout-v4.md` section 1).

`<skill>` is this folder. It needs Node 22+ and Chrome, Edge or Chromium (ffmpeg optional).

## House rules

These nine win over everything else in this skill.

1. **No caption or description under any image, render or visual.** Licence credits go in one
   footer line.
2. **Every visual renders, never an empty ground,** at 1440, 1024, 768 and 390.
3. **One section per screen:** the hero alone on the first screen, every section exactly one or
   two screens tall at 1440x900, no second section heading peeking in. The one exception is a
   live `photo-chapters` section, three or four screens, set by the moment.
4. **Equal left and right content edges.**
5. **Hover micro-animations:** a linked card lifts 2px, a photo zooms 1.02-1.03 inside its frame,
   buttons step on hover and press on click, underlines draw, card loops cycle in 2.5-4 s, repeat
   and restart on hover. The motion layer does it; never strip or override it. No tilt, carousels
   or timed tabs. Every hero enters once on load (`data-enter`), and every page carries one dealt
   moment, two on a long page (the gate holds both).
6. **More and better real photographs where they fit;** nicer backgrounds; better heroes, layouts
   and fonts.
7. **Real full-colour icons** (a known product's real icon, never a drawn one); small diagram
   visuals in cards (a hub with branches; one input, a main processor, three parallel lanes;
   pulses running along the lines).
8. **The big award-site scenes and creative moments are part of the skill:** every page deals its
   moments (photo- and type-led off tech), but shader effects and scenes only where the trade has a
   technical subject (tech, AI, developer tools, gaming, fintech, hardware), never on a local cafe,
   bakery, guesthouse or shop: those get photographs.
9. **Addresses:** street and district only (no street given: the district), no house number, postcode or coordinates; no register
   or VAT numbers; no phone in a real format; contacts on `.example`.

## 1. The kind of business decides everything

Write the kind on the plan's first line and declare it on the page: the page type on
`<html data-type>` and `<meta name="page-type">` (the same value), and `<meta name="site-kind">`;
a place adds `<meta name="page-kind" content="place">`. The dealers take the last column
(`start.mjs --page`, `moments.mjs --page`), the hero dealer the page type; `consistency.mjs` reads
the metas.

| Brief | page type | site-kind | kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| App, SaaS, AI, developer tool, fintech or banking app, a studio selling its own software | software | software | software |
| A game, a studio launching its game | software | gaming | gaming |
| Hardware or a tech device (a drone, a robot arm, a keyboard) | product | tech | tech |
| Any other physical product or brand (a chair, a bike, coffee beans sold online) | product | other | product |
| People are hired: clinic, law firm, agency, creative studio, trade | service | other | service |
| People come to it: cafe, bar, bakery, restaurant, guesthouse, small hotel, shop, florist, bike shop, gym, local studio | place | other | place |

A maker that also opens its door or teaches (a ceramics studio, a bakery with a web shop) is a
**place**; its web shop becomes the goods section. It is a product only when nothing happens at the door.

"Tech" below means site-kind software, gaming or tech; "other" is everything else. Effects,
scenes, loops, counts, CSS grounds, dark pages and dark heroes are tech only. An other page is
photographs, flat colour, type, real icons, the hero's entrance, its dealt moment (photo- or
type-led, `moments.md`) and the hover layer.

## 2. The page plan by kind

The full plans, deal lists and section order: `references/sections.md`.

- **Place** (a cafe, bakery, guesthouse, shop). Photographs lead: 12 to 20 on the full page, 8 to
  12 compact, under 8 frames the 3-screen short page, whatever the trade; no client photographs:
  the draft path and a live search (`photos.md`), then count; the palette dealt by trade. The hero
  a photograph whenever a frame fits (a remote place: its region's landscape), the visit block on
  screen two, the offer, the place, orders or booking.
  **Variety without effects** (`sections.md` section 4): the offer and the place deal different
  compositions, never two sections round one picture; one type moment (the address or name set large); one main action a screen; list text 16px. Flat grounds, square
  photographs, one button style, the phone bar, the dealt moments; no effect, ground, loop,
  fragment, diagram or tab.
- **Product and service** (site-kind other). Photographs lead: the product, the people, the rooms,
  the work, two or more a screen on a product page. Real icons for the tools a studio uses; one
  still diagram at most; flat grounds and one brand band. No shader effect, print, grain, gradient,
  scene or loop (the dealt moments only); WebGL only for a product render the brief asks for. **A
  physical product with no photographs is shown in photographs:** stand-ins of the same kind of
  thing from `photos.mjs search`, each listed in the report, on the full product page; a render
  (`assets/objects/product-render`, stills) only when the brief asks for 3D or a render; never a
  drawing, mood stock or a set of props (`sections.md`, Product).
- **Every product page** (photographed, in stand-ins or rendered on a 3D ask, hardware too; the bar is Figure and 1X;
  `sections.md`, Product): the product **big** where it stands
  whole (most of its frame, or on the ground at anchor scale), never mid-size in a grey rounded
  panel on a grey ground; **a different picture each section**, never one view twice; **every headline promise pictured** (a family bike shows the child bench); dealt
  compositions, no structure twice, one contrasting ground; the **swatch changes the picture**,
  every colour shown once; **no fact twice**; buttons step and press (rule 5).
- **Tech** (software, gaming, hardware). The client's own subject leads at true size. Software: its
  own UI as live HTML showing what it works on (a code-review tool: a red and green diff with its
  Accept action) in one `app-frame`, never a generic dashboard or only fragments on panels; cards:
  fragments on lit panels, pulsing diagrams, real icons. Hardware: its photographs, else stand-in
  photographs of its kind (a render only when the brief asks for 3D), never a split hero of only
  an order form or a drawn SVG. A game: its name in the h1, a launch line, its world as full-bleed
  key art (else its name set large over stand-in photographs of its setting), an effect never in
  its place (`sections.md`, Gaming). **60 to 80 words a screen** outside UI mocks (`copy.md`). By
  deal: **one effect** (a shader ground in the hero or the one `[data-visual]` frame, a WebGL
  part, an object or one big scene) and **one or two moments** in their own sections; four live
  WebGL contexts at most; no card moves with the scroll (`effects-usage.md`).
- **One object never carries the page.** The product or hero object whole leads the hero and **two more sections at
  most**; another kind of visual the brief supports carries the rest (`sections.md` section 1,
  its table): a game's world and crew; hardware's use at the bench, its parts close up; a still
  diagram card, a type moment, a context photograph where the trade allows.
- **The client's own assets get slots.** A trailer, key art, screenshots, CAD renders or a motion
  video the brief names each get a frame that reads finished now (a real `<video>` with a stand-in
  poster, a play control only when there is a page or file to play, three to five stand-in
  photographs of the world, a CAD frame), named in a comment for the client's file, never empty
  (`sections-library.md`, client-slots).

## 3. What serves which page

Open the reference of every asset family the page uses first. A dash means never.

| Need | Asset | Software, gaming | Hardware | Product, service | Place | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Heights, edges, heroes, type | `system.css`, `assets/layout` | dealt hero | dealt hero | dealt hero | place hero | `layout-v4.md` |
| Sections and recipes | `starter.html` | its plan | product plan | its plan | place plan | `sections.md`, `sections-library.md` |
| Tokens, grid, buttons, nav, footer, colour | `system.css`, `system.js` | yes | yes | yes | place tokens | `system.md` |
| Forms, keyboard, head and share tags | `starter.html`, `system.css`, `system.js` | yes | yes | yes | yes | `system.md` |
| Copy, contacts, credits | `scripts/copy-lint.mjs` | yes | yes | yes | yes | `copy.md`, `copy-voice.md` |
| Hero entrance, hover, press, focus, nav, tabs | `assets/motion` | yes | yes | yes | yes | `motion.md` |
| Card loops, a count | `assets/motion`, `assets/ui` | yes | yes | - | - | `motion.md`, `cards.md` |
| Photographs | `scripts/photos.mjs` | people, customers; a game's art, else stand-ins of its setting | lead | lead | lead, 12-20 | `photos.md` |
| Real tool, app and file icons | `scripts/icons.mjs` | yes | yes | tools really used | - | `icons.md` |
| Feature cards, UI fragments | `assets/ui` | lead (gaming: none) | its app | an app the client runs | - | `cards.md` |
| Diagram cards (hub, lanes, pulses) | `assets/diagrams` | 0-2, pulsing | 0-2, pulsing | 0-1, still | - | `diagrams.md` |
| CSS grounds | `assets/backgrounds` | 0-2 dealt | 0-2 dealt | flat tokens | flat tokens | `backgrounds.md` |
| Shader grounds | `assets/effects` | the one effect | the one effect | - | - | `effects-usage.md` |
| Creative parts (`fx-*`) | `assets/components` | yes | yes | `fx-photo` plain, `fx-map` still | `fx-map` still | `effects-creative.md` |
| Objects and prints | `assets/objects` | one, as the effect; a render when the brief asks for 3D | its render when the brief asks for 3D | its render when the brief asks for 3D | - | `effects-objects.md` |
| Award-site moments | `assets/moments` | 1-2 | 1-2 | 1-2 (photo, type) | 1-2 (photo, type) | `moments.md` |
| Big scenes | `assets/scenes` | 0-1 | 0-1 | - | - | `scenes.md` |
| Speed and weight | `scripts/perf.mjs` | yes | yes | yes | yes | `perf.md` |

Read `copy.md`, `copy-voice.md`, `system.md`, `layout-v4.md` and `sections.md` in full before the first page.

## 4. The run

0. **The stack.** An empty folder builds a static page: copy `<skill>/assets` into `assets` and
   start from `assets/starter.html`. An existing project builds in its own stack, its components
   taking the starter's markup and classes, with the kit copied into its public folder
   (`public/assets`) and loaded from there as plain files. A brief that asks for Next.js builds a
   static export (`output: 'export'`), checked on its built page (`--root out`).

1. **Read the brief.** Write down the kind (section 1), what is sold, who buys it, the one main
   action (the transaction: Book a room, Order a cake, Start a free trial; a place with neither:
   Get directions) and the real material: logo, screens, photographs, prices, address, hours.
   Then arm the finish gate, before any page exists:

   ```bash
   node <skill>/scripts/gate.mjs --start index.html --kind <kind> --category "<what is sold>" --primary "<main action>"
   ```

   A framework build names its dev server's URL (`--start http://localhost:5173/`) or its built page
   (`--start dist/index.html --root dist`; a Next.js export: `out`) in place of `index.html`, and
   rebuilds before every gate run.

2. **Write all the copy first,** with the copy layer (`copy-voice.md`: the fact sheet, the voice
   card on the plan, the page's shape, the device budget; a register from `copy-registers.md`, the
   moves of `copy-moves.md`) within the rules of `copy.md`: the h1 names the category and the buyer or the place (a game: its name and genre),
   one hard fact on the first screen, a noun in every heading, buttons as a verb and an object.
   Nothing is invented but a coined brand name (searched first, the result kept in `names.json`
   beside the page) and, on a place, plausible hours and prices, each marked `data-assumed`
   (`copy.md`, What may be assumed). A draft kept in a `.md` file lints the same way as the page
   (the voice card and part labels are skipped).

3. **Plan the page as screens.** Line 1: the kind. Line 2: the deal (step 4), with one sentence on
   why the palette fits the trade. Then one line per
   section: its id, its one idea, its picture and its kind (object, use, parts, world, slot, diagram, type; three object lines at most), its
   screens (1 or 2, from its content height, `layout-v4.md` section 2), which section holds a
   moment and why it moves (on tech also the effect or the scene). Pick the photographs now (`photos.md`); their count,
   stand-ins included, sets a place's length (section 2). Then read `cards.md` and the recipe of
   every id you use in `sections-library.md`.

4. **Deal, never choose by taste.** Each command keeps a history, so pages differ:

   ```bash
   node <skill>/assets/layout/deal.mjs --type <page type> --has <photo,ui,film,object,setting> --history .taste-skill/layout-history.json   # the hero; a game adds --kind gaming, hardware --kind tech
   node <skill>/scripts/start.mjs deal --page <kind> --trade <trade> --history .taste-skill/history.json    # three palettes made for the trade, three pairings: take the first; add --axis after a word or editorial hero
   node <skill>/scripts/start.mjs css --page <kind> --palette <id> --type <id> --radius soft --history .taste-skill/history.json
   node <skill>/scripts/start.mjs brand --page place --bg "#.." --ink "#.." --accent "#.." [--surface "#.."] [--muted "#.."] --type <id> --radius soft   # the client's own colours (a logo, a painted shopfront), in place of css
   node <skill>/scripts/moments.mjs pick --page <kind> --count 1|2 --fits section,statement --photo --history .taste-skill/history.json   # every kind
   node -e "for(const l of process.argv.slice(1)){const o=l.split('|');console.log(o[Math.floor(Math.random()*o.length)])}" <the kind's lists, below>
   ```

5. **Build.** In `starter.html`: set `<html lang data-type data-radius data-buttons data-motion>`
   (lang: the brief's language), the three metas, the head block (title, description, og, icon,
   theme-color: `system.md`, Head) and the nav class; keep the skip link and the `m-enter` head
   line; copy only the `<section class="hero …" data-enter>` of
   `assets/layout/hero-<id>.html` (never its nav, other sections, footer or credit line; every word
   and picture becomes the client's); move the dealt close and footer out of their `<template>`s
   and delete the rest. Every section is `main > section` with
   one `.wrap`, its h2 first, `--h: 1` or `2`. Build each to its recipe with the system's classes
   and tokens.

6. **Check and look.** Only the skill's scripts, each running one headless Chrome with WebGL on the
   CPU, closed by its own PID, one at a time in the foreground with a 10-minute timeout; never in
   the background, a windowed browser or a browser tool.

7. **Report:** the `GATE:` line first, then every waiver with its reason and every open FAIL.

## 5. Checklist

- **First screen:** says what is sold, for whom or where, with one hard fact.
- **One section per screen:** every section 1 or 2 screens, its h2 first and top-aligned.
- **Equal edges:** every block on the `.wrap` lines or the grid's columns, nothing out to one side.
- **Every visual draws** at 1440, 1024, 768 and 390.
- **No caption** explains, apologises for or labels a picture; credits in one footer line.
- **Motion:** every button, link, linked card and linked photograph visibly answers the pointer.
- **Fast:** no FAIL row in `perf.mjs`.

## 6. Never

- A card, row or tile that fades in on scroll; a fade-in on every section; parallax on text;
  scroll-jacking; random blinking.
- Stock photographs passed off as the client's product, people or place.
- A drawn look-alike of a real logo; invented reviews, quotes, customers or figures.
- Violet or lavender in the page's own design.
